The experiment in this folder runs the 1D linear wave equation solver. This experiment aims to verify the correctness of the numerical implementation by looking at the convergence rate of the finite element solution for different degree of the polynomial basis. We will look at the convergence of

* p = 2
* p = 3
* p = 4
* p = 5
