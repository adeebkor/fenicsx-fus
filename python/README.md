The example folder contains example scripts for different problems. For 
example, to run linear_planewave2d.py, do:

  `python3 examples/linear_planewave2d.py`

The scripts can also be run on multiple processes. For example, to run the
linear_planewave2d.py on 4 processes, do:

  `mpirun -n 4 python3 examples/linear_planewave2d.py`
