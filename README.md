FEniCSx implementation for high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) simulation. 

## Introduction

A high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) technique is a non-invasive medical 
technique that uses ultrasound for tissue heating and ablation.
HIFU generates acoustic waves using well-placed transducers to heat 
unwanted tissue while keeping the surrounding tissue unaffacted.
