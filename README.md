FEniCSx implementation for high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) simulation. 

## Introduction

A high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) technique is a non-invasive medical 
tech-nique  that  uses  ultrasound  for  tissue  heating  and  ablation.
HIFU  generates  acousticwaves  using  well-placed  transducers  to  heat 
unwanted  tissue  while  keeping  the  sur-rounding tissue unaffacted
